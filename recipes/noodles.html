    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li> 1 (8 ounce) package egg noodles</li>
        <li> 3 tablespoons butter </li>
        <li> Â½ pound bacon </li>
        <li> 1 onion, chopped </li>
        <li> Small head cabbage, chopped </li>
        <li> 1 dash garlic salt </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        
        <strong><li>Step 1</li></strong>
        
            <p>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the egg noodles; return to a boil. Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the noodles are cooked through, but still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain; return to the pot and stir in the butter.</p>
        
        <strong><li>Step 2</li></strong>

            <p>Meanwhile, place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate.</p>

        <strong><li>Step 3</li></strong>
        
            <p>Place the onion into the skillet with the bacon grease, and cook and stir over medium heat until the onion begins to soften, about 2 minutes. Stir in the cabbage, and cook and stir until wilted, about 5 minutes. Chop the bacon, add it to the skillet, and cook until the cabbage is tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the noodles, and continue cooking just until heated through.</p>
